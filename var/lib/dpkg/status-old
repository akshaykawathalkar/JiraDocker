Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or

 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the
 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: pthread stubs not provided by native libc, development files
 This library provides weak aliases for pthread functions not provided
 in libc or otherwise available by default.  Libraries like libxcb rely
 on pthread stubs to use pthreads optionally, becoming thread-safe when
 linked to libpthread, while avoiding any performance hit when running
 single-threaded. libpthread-stubs supports this behavior even on
 platforms which do not supply all the necessary pthread stubs.
 .
 On platforms which already supply all the necessary pthread stubs, this
 package ships only the pkg-config file pthread-stubs.pc, to allow
 libraries to unconditionally express a dependency on pthread-stubs and
 still obtain correct behavior.

 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.

 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 GnuPG 1.4 is the standalone, non-modularized series. In contrast to
 the version 2 series, shipped with the gnupg2 package, it comes
 with no support for S/MIME and some other tools useful for desktop
 environments, but also with less dependencies.
 .
 The gnupg package is built without libcurl. So it does not support
 HKPS keyservers. Install the gnupg-curl package if you want to use
 the keyserver helper tools built with libcurl and supporting HKPS.

Description: Core Perl modules
 Architecture independent Perl modules.  These modules are part of Perl and
 required if the `perl' package is installed.
 .
 Note that this package only exists to save archive space and should be
 considered an internal implementation detail of the `perl' package.
 Other packages should not depend on `perl-modules' directly, they
 should use `perl' (which depends on `perl-modules') instead.

Description: Layout and rendering of internationalized text
 Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
 on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout is
 needed. however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the GTK+
 widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text and
 font handling for GTK+-2.0.
 .
 Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used with
 four different font backends:
  - Core X windowing system fonts
  - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
  - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
  - Native fonts on Microsoft backends
 .

Description: easy to use distributed version control system
 Bazaar is a distributed version control system designed to be easy to
 use and intuitive, able to adapt to many workflows, reliable, and
 easily extendable.
 .
 Publishing of branches can be done over plain HTTP, that is, no special
 software is needed on the server to host Bazaar branches. Branches can
 be pushed to the server via sftp (which most SSH installations come
 with), FTP, or over a custom and faster protocol if bzr is installed in
 the remote end.
 .
 Merging in Bazaar is easy, as the implementation is able to avoid many
 spurious conflicts, deals well with repeated merges between branches,
 and is able to handle modifications to renamed files correctly.
 .
 Bazaar is written in Python, and has a flexible plugin interface which
 can be used to extend its functionality. Many plugins exist, providing
 useful commands (bzrtools), graphical interfaces (qbzr), or native
 interaction with Subversion branches (bzr-svn).
 .
 Install python-paramiko if you are going to push branches to remote
 hosts with sftp.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor library - runtime
 This package contains libbzip2 which is used by the bzip2 compressor.
 .
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, high-quality data compressor.
 It typically compresses files to within 10% to 15% of the best available
 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding. Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.
 .
 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: GNOME XML library
 XML is a metalanguage to let you design your own markup language.
 A regular markup language defines a way to describe information in
 a certain class of documents (eg HTML). XML lets you define your
 own customized markup languages for many classes of document. It
 can do this because it's written in SGML, the international standard
 metalanguage for markup languages.
 .
 This package provides a library providing an extensive API to handle
 such XML data files.

 documents on UNIX shell command prompt as well as for automated XML processing
 with shell scripts.
 .
 The toolkit's feature set includes options to:
  Check or validate XML files (simple well-formedness check, DTD, XSD, RelaxNG)
  Calculate values of XPath expressions on XML files (such as running sums, etc)
  Search XML files for matches to given XPath expressions
  Apply XSLT stylesheets to XML documents (including EXSLT support, and passing
 parameters to stylesheets)
  Query XML documents (ex. query for value of some elements of attributes,
 sorting, etc)
  Modify or edit XML documents (ex. delete some elements)
  Format or "beautify" XML documents (as changing indentation, etc)
  Fetch XML documents using http:// or ftp:// URLs
  Browse tree structure of XML documents (in similar way to 'ls' command for
 directories)
  Include one XML document into another using XInclude
  XML c14n canonicalization
  Escape/unescape special XML characters in input text
  Print directory as XML document
  Convert XML into PYX format (based on ESIS - ISO 8879), and vice versa

 techniques, whilst being around twice as fast at compression and six
 times faster at decompression.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 ..
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: low level cryptographic library (symmetric and one-way cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: Advanced version control system
 Apache Subversion, also known as svn, is a centralised version control
 system.  Version control systems allow many individuals (who may be
 distributed geographically) to collaborate on a set of files (source
 code, websites, etc).  Subversion began with a CVS paradigm and
 supports all the major features of CVS, but has evolved to support
 many features that CVS users often wish they had.
 .
 This package includes the Subversion client (svn), repository
 administration tools (svnadmin, svnlook) and a network server (svnserve).

Description: Tomcat native library using the Apache Portable Runtime
 Tomcat can use the Apache Portable Runtime to provide superior scalability,
 performance, and better integration with native server technologies.
 The Apache Portable Runtime is a highly portable library that is at the
 heart of Apache HTTP Server 2.x. APR has many uses, including access to
 advanced IO functionality (such as sendfile, epoll and OpenSSL), OS level
 functionality (random number generation, system status, etc), and native
 process handling (shared memory, NT pipes and Unix sockets).
 .
 These features allows making Tomcat a general purpose webserver, will
 enable much better integration with other native web technologies, and
 overall make Java much more viable as a full fledged webserver platform
 rather than simply a backend focused technology.

 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: system login tools
 These tools are required to be able to login and use your system. The
 login program invokes your user shell and enables command execution. The
 newgrp program is used to change your effective group ID (useful for
 workgroup type situations). The su program allows changing your effective
 user ID (useful being able to execute commands as another user).

Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters (extra variants)
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .
 This package includes additional variants, such as oblique, italic,
 bold-oblique, bold-italic and the condensed forms.
 .
 DejaVu fonts are intended for use on low-resolution devices (mainly
 computer screens) but can be used in printing as well.

Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.
 .

 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

 Xlib:
 .
  * Size: small library and lower memory footprint
  * Latency hiding: batch several requests and wait for the replies later
  * Direct protocol access: one-to-one mapping between interface and protocol
  * Thread support: access XCB from multiple threads, with no explicit locking
  * Easy creation of new extensions: automatically generates interface from
    machine-parsable protocol descriptions

Description: fast, scalable, distributed revision control system
 Git is popular version control system designed to handle very large
 projects with speed and efficiency; it is used for many high profile
 open source projects, most notably the Linux kernel.
 .
 Git falls in the category of distributed source code management tools.
 Every Git working directory is a full-fledged repository with full
 revision tracking capabilities, not dependent on network access or a
 central server.
 .
 This package provides the git main components with minimal dependencies.
 Additional functionality, e.g. a graphical user interface and revision
 tree visualizer, tools for interoperating with other VCS's, or a web
 interface, is provided as separate git* packages.

Description: SELinux library for manipulating binary security policies
 Security-enhanced Linux is a patch of the Linux kernel and a number
 of utilities with enhanced security functionality designed to add
 mandatory access controls to Linux.  The Security-enhanced Linux
 kernel contains new architectural components originally developed to
 improve the security of the Flask operating system. These
 architectural components provide general support for the enforcement
 of many kinds of mandatory access control policies, including those
 based on the concepts of Type Enforcement®, Role-based Access
 Control, and Multi-level Security.
 .
 libsepol provides an API for the manipulation of SELinux binary policies.
 It is used by checkpolicy (the policy compiler) and similar tools, as well
 as by programs like load_policy that need to perform specific transformations
 on binary policies such as customizing policy boolean settings.

 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 The daemon can be found in the dbus package.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.
